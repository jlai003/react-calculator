Adapted from [Learning React and Redux: decoupling with stateless components](https://www.udemy.com/course/1326760/)

Shows how to...
- Create reusable **stateless** and easily testable components
- Create pure & easily testable action handlers (**reducers**)
- Connect stateless views with stateless reducers through **React containers**
- Refactor applications to be more testable and reusable (**decoupled**)
- Understand React **Flux architecture** and how to connect all the bits

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
